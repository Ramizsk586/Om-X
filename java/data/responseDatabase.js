  "how api works": [
    "**Omni Neural Pipeline Logic:**\n\n" +
    "Om-X uses a multi-stage **Intelligence Failover System**:\n\n" +
    "1. **Local Pre-flight**: The request is checked against the local Response DB for instant answers.\n" +
    "2. **Primary Provider**: The request is sent to your selected cloud provider (e.g., Google Gemini 3.0).\n" +
    "3. **Circuit Breaker**: If the provider fails (API limit, network error), the system initiates a cooldown.\n" +
    "4. **Neural Failover**: The request is automatically rerouted to the next provider in your failover chain (e.g., Groq or OpenRouter).\n" +
    "5. **Ollama Fallback**: If all cloud paths are down, Om-X attempts to use a local **Ollama** instance if enabled, ensuring 100% private processing."
  ],

  "privacy-details": [
    "**Privacy & Data Protection Policy:**\n\n" +
    "Om-X is designed with a **Privacy-First** mindset:\n\n" +
    "- **Local-First Storage**: Your history, bookmarks, and settings stay on your machine. We do not have servers that store your browsing data.\n" +
    "- **Zero-Knowledge Vault**: Credential signatures in the password vault are encrypted with AES-256 using your Master Key. Even the browser doesn't know your key until you type it.\n" +
    "- **Neural Anonymization**: When sending data to AI providers, only the necessary page text is transmitted. No tracking IDs or biometric markers are included in the metadata.\n" +
    "- **Ad Shield**: Blockers prevent third-party trackers from profiling your behavior across the web."
  ],

  "guardian-technical": [
    "**Zero-Trust Guardian Technical Specs:**\n\n" +
    "The Guardian uses a scoring system based on three vectors:\n\n" +
    "1. **Host Reputation**: Checked against our curated malware and adult domain lists.\n" +
    "2. **Content Intent**: Real-time keyword scanning of URLs and page titles.\n" +
    "3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Detects aggressive redirection, suspicious script execution, and resource hoarding.\n\n" +
    "If a domain accumulates a **Risk Score > 40**, it is immediately isolated, and the Site Lock protocol is engaged."
  ],

  "search matrix info": [
    "**The Search Matrix System:**\n\n" +
    "Om-X allows you to manage an array of 'Neural Search Links'. You can customize:\n\n" +
    "- **Triggers**: Assign unique hotkeys to instantly search specific engines.\n" +
    "- **Interactive Search**: Some engines (like DeepSeek or ChatGPT) are marked as 'INTERACTIVE'. When you search them, Omni automatically injects your query into their input fields after the page loads.\n" +
    "- **Direct Links**: Search Wikipedia or documentation sites by appending your query directly to their URL path."
  ],

  "translator logic": [
    "**Unified Translation Pipeline:**\n\n" +
    "Om-X orchestrates three layers of translation:\n\n" +
    "1. **Mozilla Layer**: Uses local dictionary files for instant, offline translation of common phrases.\n" +
    "2. **Chromium Layer**: Uses the integrated engine for bulk, fast translations of large text blocks.\n" +
    "3. **API Repair**: For high-nuance text, Omni uses your configured AI providers to 'repair' translations, ensuring grammar and cultural context are preserved."
  ],

  "update lineage": [
    "**Version History & Lineage:**\n\n" +
    "- **v1.4.0 (Current)**: Implementation of the Advanced Neural Vault and dedicated Omni Chat tab. Refined Zinc Glass UI.\n" +
